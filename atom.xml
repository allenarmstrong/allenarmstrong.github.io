   <title>My Move from Windows Phone to iOS and the iPhone 6 Plus</title>

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I finally did it... well some people said that when I told them that I now am an owner of an iPhone 6+. Or as I would tell them - I&amp;#39;m drinking the Koolaid &amp;trademark;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was just a matter of time really. I love gadgets and phones and want to try out and use all of them. My first smartphone was the Samsung Blackjack (the first) running Windows Mobile 5. Then I breifly had a Palm Pixie and the very beautiful WebOS. I really loved the small form factor and keyboard but just had too many bugs in the OS. So I traded it in for a Blackberry Curve. Again... loved the keyboard and had that guy for my full 2 year contract. But the writing was on the wall for Blackberry and I didnt want to be left behind. I went with with the Motorola Atrix 2. This was a good phone, but after a year, it was getting slow and being left behind. Thats the problem with Android... its so fragmented and the hardware is widespread, when Google updates the OS with major advancements and all the great forward thinking features... 1 year old phones get left to collect dust. After one year, I was lucky to get IceCream Sandwich, and no hopes of getting anything above that. And besides, that new awesome Windows Phone 8 was just comming out and I just so happen to catch a great deal (free) on the HTC 8X. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The 8X was/is a good phone. I&amp;#39;ve had for it over two years. It&amp;#39;s taken a beating, dropped, cracked glass... but still holds up. There were some short-comings... 1. Apps - yes most of the major apps are on there or there are really good 3rd party versions. but it never took off... and there&amp;#39;s starting to be some developers that are dropping support. Major banks (including the one I use) are dropping support. Also my carrier doesnt seem to want to push out an OS update and I was now quite a few versions behind... with some major changes that would have made the phone so much better. Visions of Android came rushing back.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So when the iPhone 6 and iOS 8 were announced... I was excited. More so for iOS 8. As a web developer and full time OSX user, I really like the new continuity features between iOS and OSX. Being able to share things between devices, getting phone calls and sms/texts on my Macbook Pro, making calls from the computer or my iPad. I was in! Yeah... I&amp;#39;m lazy. I mean I like to be more effient and productive (yeah thats the ticket). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was really &lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Introduction</title>

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Hello and welcome. I&amp;#39;ve decided to redesign my main site allenarmstrong.com into 2 identities &amp;mdash; &lt;a href=&quot;http://music.allenarmstrong.com&quot;&gt;My Music&lt;/a&gt; and this site, &lt;a href=&quot;http://words.allenarmstrong.com&quot;&gt;The Words I Write&lt;/a&gt;. The old site was a portfolio site to show off my work to clients or potenial new employers, but as I tell recruiters (almost everday)... I&amp;#39;m not looking for work right now. I&amp;#39;m very happy with where I&amp;#39;m at now. I&amp;#39;m a web desinger/developer for &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.flvs.net&quot;&gt;Florida Virtual School&lt;/a&gt; and I really am happy and love what I&amp;#39;m doing. I design the course-ware that educates the youth of Florida and wordwide. I&amp;#39;ve been designing and building websites since the mid 90&amp;#39;s, and most of them have been in one way or the other, trying to sell you something. Cars, Motorcycles, Vacations, Software, Video games, clothing, stocks... you name it, I&amp;#39;ve built a site trying to sell it. What I&amp;#39;m doing at FLVS is so rewarding, knowing it&amp;#39;s educating the youth. I get to work from home, I get paid well and the people are the greatest... whats not to love, why would I want a new job?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The previous site was a Wordpress site... and like so many others, I decided that it&amp;#39;s become a little more than what I really need. I&amp;#39;ve used it since 07 or 08 when I first started blogging. I had a photoblog - I Don&amp;#39;t Blame You - for awhile and many other little projects and sites running on WP. But now I just want something that would be easy to maintain, fast with little overhead... don&amp;#39;t have to worry about constantly applying security patches and updates. I&amp;#39;ve been reading about flat-file CMS&amp;#39;s for the last year or so, and even played around a little with some. I&amp;#39;ve finally decided to go in on Jekyll.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So what is this site going to be about... basically a little about everything. I&amp;#39;ll probably still post about projects at work, or some of my photography... so it will still sorta be a portfolio... but in a different format. A personal portfolio.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But this isn&amp;#39;t going to be a brain dump - link sharing blog. I didn&amp;#39;t want it to be. And I think that&amp;#39;s why I decided to go with a flat-file system as well.. that&amp;#39;s one of the beauties of it. I think it will require more thought and purpose behind every post. To go through and format your post, the republish, commit the changes, ect. It&amp;#39;s more methodical, more to the process... and I like that. It&amp;#39;s almost like an art, each step important in the total outcome. Like back in the day, when I wrote more often for zines - it was a process and an art.&lt;/p&gt;
