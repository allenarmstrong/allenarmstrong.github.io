	<p>I finally did it... well some people said that when I told them that I now am an owner of an iPhone 6+. Or as I would tell them - I&#39;m drinking the Koolaid &trademark;. </p>

<p>It was just a matter of time really. I love gadgets and phones and want to try out and use all of them. My first smartphone was the Samsung Blackjack (the first) running Windows Mobile 5. Then I breifly had a Palm Pixie and the very beautiful WebOS. I really loved the small form factor and keyboard but just had too many bugs in the OS. So I traded it in for a Blackberry Curve. Again... loved the keyboard and had that guy for my full 2 year contract. But the writing was on the wall for Blackberry and I didnt want to be left behind. I went with with the Motorola Atrix 2. This was a good phone, but after a year, it was getting slow and being left behind. Thats the problem with Android... its so fragmented and the hardware is widespread, when Google updates the OS with major advancements and all the great forward thinking features... 1 year old phones get left to collect dust. After one year, I was lucky to get IceCream Sandwich, and no hopes of getting anything above that. And besides, that new awesome Windows Phone 8 was just comming out and I just so happen to catch a great deal (free) on the HTC 8X. </p>

<p>The 8X was/is a good phone. I&#39;ve had for it over two years. It&#39;s taken a beating, dropped, cracked glass... but still holds up. There were some short-comings... 1. Apps - yes most of the major apps are on there or there are really good 3rd party versions. but it never took off... and there&#39;s starting to be some developers that are dropping support. Major banks (including the one I use) are dropping support. Also my carrier doesnt seem to want to push out an OS update and I was now quite a few versions behind... with some major changes that would have made the phone so much better. Visions of Android came rushing back.</p>

<p>So when the iPhone 6 and iOS 8 were announced... I was excited. More so for iOS 8. As a web developer and full time OSX user, I really like the new continuity features between iOS and OSX. Being able to share things between devices, getting phone calls and sms/texts on my Macbook Pro, making calls from the computer or my iPad. I was in! Yeah... I&#39;m lazy. I mean I like to be more effient and productive (yeah thats the ticket). </p>

<p>I was really </p>
